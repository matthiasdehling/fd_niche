## Example analysis
The file [Example_FD_roles.R](Example_FD_roles.R) contains a sample workflow that (i) reads in network and trait data, (ii) calculates species' functional role diversity, and (iii) computes dissimilarity of functional roles at the network and species levels.

## Repository organization
Example data files can be found in the [Data](Data) directory. Please refer to these when formatting your own data. All underlying functions are defined in scripts in the [Functions](Functions) directory. Please refer to these or the original publication for more information regarding the various calculations.
